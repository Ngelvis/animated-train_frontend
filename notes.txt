DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation
--------------------------------------------
Modify structure
Change style
Add or remove element
Respond to events (click e.t.c)
Access elements (getElementById e.t.c)




Arithmetic operators + * - /
Comparison operators ==  != > <
Logical operators 
            AND - && both of them
            OR - || 0ne of them
            NOT - ! either one of them or none

Assignment Operators 

            assign =
            add and assign +=
            subtract and assign -=

Unary Operators 

            decrement --
            increment ++

Ternary Operators

            condition ? value1 : value2


CONTROL FLOW
      1. Conditional Statement if...else statement
      2. Loops - Its loops through until a condition is met for,while, do..while
      

STRING METHODS
      .slice()
      .replace()
      .toLowerCase()
      .toUpperCase()
      .split()
      .repeat()
      .indexOf()
      .subString()
      .lastIndexOf()

NUMBER METHODS 
      .toFixed()
      Number.isInteger()
      Math.floor()
      Math.max()


ARRAYS AND FUNCTIONS
--------------------------

ARRAYS 

similar items 
Items have an index number
Arrays count from zero (0)
you can add items
you can remove items
you can change items



FUNCTIONS

takes input (parameters or argument)
give output
helps to divide your code into modules (use it to organize your code)
it is reuseable
makes your code clean
items in an array are called elements

Function METHODS

.push() - adds a new element to the array
.pop() - removes the last element from the array 
.splice() - helps to replace items in an array
.concat() - joins two arrays together
.map()  - helps you map out items in an array
.sort() - sorts elements
.filter() - filters out elements that meets certain conditions


TYPES OF FUNCTIONS 
----------------------
Functions allow you to divide your code into modules and makes your code clean.
Functions can be stand alone or nested.

1.Named Functions - key word "function" & "name" (can be defined anywhere in your code)
2. Anonymous Functions - 
      They are decleared without a name  
      they are callback Functions or immediately invoked
      They do not require  

3. Arrow Functions
      They have a concise syntax 
      And are Anonymous by nature



FUNCTION HOISTING
      Helps to call a function before declaration



OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)
      i. based on objects

      ii. contains declaration

      iii. organize your code into objects that interact with each other 

      iv. METHODS

      v. Class ===> Objects ===> Instances of that class

      vi.Encapsulation 
      
      vii. Inheritance
            it allow you to inherit properties and methods of another Class
            it allows code reuseable
            Allows us to declare hierarchy of a class

      viii. Polymorphism
            it allow objects of different classes to be treated as an object of a common super class.
            it allows for flexibility and extensibility of your software design
